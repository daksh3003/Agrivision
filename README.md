# ðŸŒ± AI-Powered Farming App

## Overview
Our AI-powered farming app is designed to assist farmers in diagnosing crop and livestock diseases with real-time alerts, data-driven insights, and other essential functionalities. Developed during a hackathon, this app integrates machine learning models to help farmers efficiently identify and tackle agricultural problems. It is built using **Flutter**, with **Firebase** integration for authentication and data storage.

## Features
- **AI Disease Diagnostics**: The app uses machine learning models to diagnose diseases in crops and livestock based on user input (images, symptoms, etc.). The model supports diagnosis for multiple types of crops and animals.
- **Real-time Alerts**: Farmers receive notifications when their crops or livestock are diagnosed with diseases, along with actionable advice for treatment.
- **Offline Access**: Recognizing that not all farmers have continuous internet access, we designed the app to work in offline mode, allowing them to access critical functionalities even without connectivity.
- **Multilingual Support**: The app offers support for multiple languages to ensure accessibility to farmers from diverse regions.
- **Marketplace**: The app includes a marketplace feature, enabling farmers to sell their crops directly to consumers or retailers without middlemen, improving their profit margins.
- **Community Section**: Farmers can interact with each other, ask questions, and provide solutions to fellow farmers' issues via a community forum.
- **Seller Chat**: A built-in chat feature enables farmers to communicate directly with sellers or buyers for faster transactions and better coordination.
